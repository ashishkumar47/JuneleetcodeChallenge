Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k),
 where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height
 greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example 1
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

The idea to solve the problem is to arrange the queue in such a way that k people will be placed infront of the
element which has height greater than or equal to the element.we first sort the array in increasing order.
first based on there height, if there height is same then on the basis of the k.
we can't put higher k count value infront of lower k count value.this will disturb the sequence of queue.
suppose,
[5,1] and [5,2]
[5,2] can't be placed infront of [5,1] because it needs only one element greater than its height but [5,2] needs
2 element.if we place 2 elements infront of it then it will disturb the count of [5,1].
and then place each element in the list on the basis of there k value and then convert the list in array and
return.
