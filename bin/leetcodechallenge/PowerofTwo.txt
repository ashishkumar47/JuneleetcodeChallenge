Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:
Input: 1
Output: true
Explanation: 2^0 = 1


Example 2:
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 2^4 = 16


Example 3:
Input: 218
Output: false

The idea to solve the problem is taking a and between the current number and its previous number, nad if it
comes out to be zero then the number is power of two.
